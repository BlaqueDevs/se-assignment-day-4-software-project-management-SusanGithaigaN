## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

 Agile methodology is ideal for projects with evolving requirements and a high degree of uncertainty, while Waterfall suits projects with well-defined scopes and less need for flexibility

*Agile Methodology.*
| Advantages                                                  | Disadvantages                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flexible in responding to the market                        | Has loose testing requirements that often times let bugs through |
| The team shares progress and incoporates feedabck into the process| The project timeline is more difficult to determine from the start as the project is suceptible to change.|
| The implementation team has room for creative problem solving| Relentless pace                                                 |



*Waterfall Methodology.*

| Advantages                                                  | Disadvantages                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The project plan is precise and has strict deadlines        | Due to time constraints, there are fewer opportunities to course correct|
| There is a predictable and well-defines final product       | There are too manugaps between innovation and reaching the target market|
| Well-defined roles and responsibilities                     | Beaurocratic change management process                                  |


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile is more beneficial than Waterfall in projects with evolving requirements and a high degree of uncertainty, while Waterfall is more beneficial in projects with well-defined scopes and less need for flexibility.

*Example of a project suited for Agile methodology.*
*Developing a mobile money transfer app for users. In this scenario, the developmant team first has to do a market research and come up with a list of challenges & expectations that their target audience has when doing mobile money tranfers. This feedback will then be used to create an app that soles these clint needs and meets their expectations*

*Example of a project suited for Waterfall methodology.*
 *Perfoming a system upgrade for a banking system.In this scenario, the project involves critical financial operations with strict regulatory compliance. Requirements must be clearly defined and fully understood before development begins, with rigorous testing in a controlled sequence to ensure no disruptions to banking services.*

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

Quality assurance is crucial in software project management as it ensures that the final product meets the required standards and is free from defects.

*Methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project*

*1. Audit.*
Involves the inspection of the progress and the product to determine whether the set of actions written in the original document that should be followed are being followed or not.

*2. Review*
This is the process where both the product developers and users/customers gather for a meeting to examine the progress and the product. The clients give their comments on the product progress and suggest implementations that they want on the product so that it can meet their expectations/approval.

*3. Testing*
This involves examining the software by using the tools that develop real-life situations to assess the behavior of the software.

*4. Code analysis*
Thisis done by developers and is implemented through pair programming or doing peer code reviews so as to improve code qulaity and reduce the likelihood of product defects.

*5. Six sigma quality assurance*
The sole purpose of using this technique is to elevate the quality and efficiency of the system up to 99.7%, free from any bugs, errors, and defects.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

Defining the project scope is crucial in project planning as it helps to identify the specific goals, objectives and deliverables of the project. It also helps to determine the resources required, the timeline, and the budget.
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of the project into smaller, manageable tasks. It is useful as it helps to identify the specific tasks required to complete the project, and to estimate the time and resources required for each task.

**A WBS(work breakdown structure) is useful in project planning as it helps to:**

*Identify the specific tasks required to complete the project*
*Estimate the time and resources required for each task*
*Create a detailed project schedule*
*Identify potential risks and opportunities*
*Facilitate communication among team members and stakeholders*

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

Developing a detailed project schedule is crucial in project planning as it helps to identify the specific tasks required to complete the project, and to estimate the time and resources required for each task.

A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule, showing the start and finish dates of the tasks and the dependencies between them.

The benefits of developing a detailed project schedule include:

*Improved project planning and management*
*Better resource allocation and utilization*
*Enhanced communication among team members and stakeholders*
*Increased productivity and efficiency*
*Reduced project risk and uncertainty*

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
